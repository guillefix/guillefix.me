    You will notice that we have numbers like 4353-11a2 with each 2-anisohedral tile. Since these are 2-anisohedral we have two classes of tiles: let tile A be from one class and Tile B from the other class. The classification number 4353-11a2 would tell us that Tile A has 4 neighbors and Tile B has 5 neighbors. The little threes tell us that Tile A has three neighbors who are Bs, and Tile B has three neighbors who are As. Note that the neighbor numbers show the ratio between the types of tiles. Most of the time these are in a one to one ratio with the only currently known exception being the unbalanced tiling which was discovered in 2002 which has the neighbor numbers 3 and 6 for a ratio of 1:2. The number and letter after the dash are part of the full topological classification explained by Delgado, Huson, and Zamorzaeva. The final number (or letter) is merely so that I can name the different tilings. I tried to add them in chronological order of when the tiles were published.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://www.angelfire.com/mn3/anisohedral/explain.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://www.angelfire.com/mn3/anisohedral/explain.html</a></p><p>In 2003, Joseph Myers, exhibited a remarkable 10-isohedral tile â€” apparently the current record.
