They assume the force of the buckling columns on the damaged story to be equal to the weight of the part of the building above. However, that would imply no net force, and constant velocity, which is against the very clear constant acceleration, they themselves report. 
In the closure Bazant et all also point out several other places where Szuladzinski seems to lack not only understanding of structural mechanics, but of basic physics. This may not be surprising given that he isn't an engineer or physicist, but a &quot;specialist in homeland security&quot;.</p><p>Again, the paper by the Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth mainly cites Szuladzinski et al.'s paper, and their conclusions are based on incorrect calculations.</p><p>Their comments on the pitfalls of the NIST report also seem unbased when you actually look at what's in the report.</p><hr><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=861610" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NIST report</a></p>
