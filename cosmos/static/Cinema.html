I know that from the past, and Im
happy with that</p><p>Apart from that, I really liked the soundtrack, and I do think the movie
is visually interesting. Just one of many examples: there is a transition
from a scene with a fireplace where the levitating embers blend into
city lights. The whole cyberpunk vibe is very well achieved in many
cityscape scenes too</p><p>Regarding the plot things you mentioned.. The way l see movies, I
think you are asking too many questions.. Or rather, the wrong kinds of questions. I like to see movies, not as something that was created by someone to impress me. I like to see movies as if they really happened. I like to get in their world, and forget the real world. Plot holes sometimes appear, but I take it as: &quot;Oh, this is weird, why is this happening?&quot;, and then I start some internal world-specific scientific process, where I try to look for within-world explanations, and stuff. The people who made the film are the last people who I think of while watching it. In this way, you don't think about &quot;Why did they chcose A over B, or C over D&quot;, but instead you wonder about &quot;how did the world end up in this state? why does this guy have a holographic girl? Is he lonely? Is that part of society? Is it because of the power of Wallace industries?&quot; &quot;Why does this guy have so much power?&quot; &quot;Why are people so immoral with respect to replicants?&quot; &quot;Is the media taking a role?&quot; &quot;Are all this sexually-protrayed girl ads, just part of a media system trying to numb people by letting them escape from their real dystopian situation?&quot; &quot;Is the whole aesthetic of a futuristic/cyberpunk world helping making people forget the problems with their society, by indulging in hedonistic enjoyment?&quot; 
I actually thought the plot was interesting too. The conflict between keeping order, versus showing society the harsh truth that they are killing real humans, versus the crazy dreams of a crazy visionary. The question of real vs fake memories, of trying to find who one really is, in a world where an &quot;information blackout&quot; and memory-creation, makes the past seem like it didn't exist. The contrast with the casino in the radiation zone, being frozen in time.</p><p>Btw, the sculptures and aesthetic from the radiation zone I think are probably inspired by Burning Man, as they have quite similar things.</p><p>And then the other type of questions, I can't help myself to ask: &quot;how is all this technology possible?&quot; &quot;What is making the cars fly?&quot; &quot;How does the holograms work?&quot; &quot;How can that little device project it/and sense the external world so effectively?&quot; &quot;some advance image processing? or are there more external sensors not being shown?...&quot; &quot;why are replicants so obedient?&quot; &quot;what are these psychological test? Is it similar to Asimov's robopsychology?&quot;....</p></div>
