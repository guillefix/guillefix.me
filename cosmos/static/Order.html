Criticallity? Chaos. Information which was previously trapped at the microscale, and very implicit (constantly changing its physical representation, as particles move and bounce around), suddenly became more explicit and emerged into a physical representation, localized in space, and persistent in time. Eventually reaching larger and larger spatial scales. From physical information  came physical computation, etc.</p><p>But before this, there was already computation. Invisible computation and information, that we may not know how to interpret. But what if in that computation, whole worlds are being simulated, created and destroyed. Boltzmann worlds, Boltzmann computation. What is being computed in the air in your room? Random gibberish? Probably.. but.. </p><p>Why is that computation more gibberish than the computation happening when you look at a flower? To us, it may look more gibberish, but is there anything fundamental distinguishing the two? Well, generally, I think the distinguishing feature is the complexity of the computation. Life is simpler.</p><p>Order out of chaos? With a physical description, it appears that life is more orderly than say a gas. </p><p>But still, the question that the gas in your room could be computing something very meaningful, is very interesting.</p><p>In a sense, science has been about this. Finding the hidden patterns in what seemed uncomprehensible before. But there could always be more.. (after all Kolmogorov complexity (the ultimate description) is uncomputable..)</p><p><strike>

What if in the apparent chaos, there's a simulated world. And to that world, the information comprising ours, is but apparent chaos. What if the programmers of the Universe programmed it in the representation corresponding to that world, and we are just an unintended and undiscovered byproduct, which to them, lies in the random noise of the fluctuation of particles (or who-knows-what their universe is composed of).</strike></p></div>
