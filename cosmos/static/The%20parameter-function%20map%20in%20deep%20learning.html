For CNNs is more complicated (see convo with Adria!) GP for resnets?
–&gt; The fact that (for dense feedforward nets) the covariance only depends on dot product, means that the neighbourhoods of points that we consider must be similar are infinite along d-1 dimensions. So we are dividing the d-dimensional space into slabs of thickness epsilon, and the curse of dimensionality doesn't seem to matter that much then! <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://youtu.be/i2bt4vt908g?t=28m4s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/i2bt4vt908g?t=28m4s</a> </p><p>Effective VC dimension approach. 
Building on work which uses low noise sensitivity of weight matrices.
VC dim / RadComp for high-prob set of functions (typical functions)
x – calculation of effective VC dimension for hard threshold networks assuming that the number of activations decreases exponentially. See notebook. Doesn't grow with depth, but otherwise, it's not that much smaller.. Hmm and not quite sure how useful, but perhaps interesting
See doc in overleaf. Conclusion: Basically, the fact that the number of activations decreases doesn't capture enough of the bias, as the generalizatio bounds we get are still proportional to the number of parameters. \texbf{Except when the number of activations becomes very small $m \lesssim n$, in which case extra layers don't really contribute. But I'm not sure how relevant this regime is in practice... I guess probably not much}}. So this doesn't seem like such a fruitful approach, except for the last caveat. Need to keep an eye to see if number of activations decreases significantly for realistic networks...</p><p>x - Uniform distribution over number of 1s for perceptron. Hmm. Have some argument for it. See notebook. WE HAVE PROVEN IT!</p><p>x - ~understand LZ-prob histogram / nn bias... I think it can be because of sampling variance causing estiamates of prob sometimes to be higher than true prob.. SEE relevant desmos plot, and uniform KL chernoff bounds!</p><p>~ - Compute probabilities for perceptron! Use solid-angle formula. Same for GP prob. Not very computationally tractable with known algorithms. Using GP approximation methods like EP/Laplace/MCMC</p><hr><p>~ - What range of complexity do we expect from the coding theorem? The answer depends on the sample size! Large deviation theory.... relevant for WWIS
Relations to dimensionality reduction. Constraints/correlations</p><hr><p>x- 1) bias in nn paper (organize what I have, think about theoretical explanation. How to bound probability with LZ. Get acquainted with current methods!) – PUBLISHED IN ICLR, success :)
x - • Read optimization reading group paper
x~ - Understand generalization in deep learning
_-_-_-_
x• Simpbias in param-fun map
x• distribution of Boolean complexities
x - Try L1 norm of Fourier coefficients for measure of Boolean function complexity . Done</p><hr><p>X - – learn low complexity low frequency</p><p><u>Results of learning low complexity low frequency functions: (LZ 21, Boolcomp 2-3, freq = 1e-8)</u></p><p>The mean generalization errors are between 0.6-0.11, compatible with functions with complexity 40-70. The PAC-Bayes predictor gives an upper bound of about 0.22, which is also the same as typical functions with complexities 40-70. Therefore, PAC-Bayes seems to capture the behaviour of these functions as well as for the previous functions tried.</p><p>Note that what matters for PAC-Bayes is P(U) not P(f_target)</p><p>The frequency of the functions found by P(U) is slightly lower but not really incompatible with those found for comp 40-70, I think. They are 1e-9 to 3e-7 while for comps 40-70 its 1e-8 to 1e-6 more or less. But these frequency estimates are probably not that accurate, and that's why we use the 2^(-aK) hoping that it is a more accurate estimate of the true probability (although we haven't quite demonstrated this).</p><ul><li><ul><li>Can I estimate error in empirical P(U)?</li></ul></li></ul><p>High frequency functions with complexity 21, have mean generrors &lt; 0.5 and closer to 0.3. This suggests that frequency estimates (or at least those estimates used in PAC-Bayes) are better predictors of which functions are going to generalize better than others, than complexity (i.e. from complexity you'd expect these to generalize better than comp 40-70.., but from PAC-Bayes, you'd expect them to be similar..)</p></div>
