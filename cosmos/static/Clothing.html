For most clothing materials, the volume of air enclosed is far greater than the volume of the fibres. Therefore <strong>the insulation is very much dependent on the thickness of the material (i.e. the enclosed air layer) and less on the fibre type</strong> (<strong>yes, but fiber structure does affect insulation, see more detailed studies above!</strong>). The fibres mainly influence the amount of radiative heat transfer, as they reflect, absorb and re-emit radiation. That this effect is of minor importance relative to the thickness (except for special reflective clothing) can be seen in figure 4, where the insulation of a range of different clothing materials is presented in relation to their thickness. Thickness appears to be the major determinant of insulation [1, 12].

Again, as the volume of fibres is usually low compared to the enclosed air volume, the resistance to the diffusion of water vapour through the garments is mainly determined by the thickness of the enclosed still air layer. With thin materials, the fibre component gets a more important role as there e.g. different weave characteristics affect the diffusion properties more than in thick materials (fig. 5).</p><p>The fibres of the clothing materials do determine other properties of the clothing like air permeability and moisture absorption however, which may affect insulation and vapour resistance in special conditions like high winds and wet environments.</p><p>I suppose <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="Heat%2520convection.html">Heat convection</a> may also play a role in some regimes, like when the clothing has openings..</p><p>When the air in the environment is moving, as usually is the case at a workplace, this air movement will disturb the still layer on the outside of the clothing. Also this air movement can disturb the air layers in the ensemble, by entering through clothing openings or, depending on the air permeability of the outer clothing layer, by penetration of the clothing fabric. <em>I suppose that heavier clothing, like wool will also move less</em></p><p>[[Heat balance when wearing protective clothing |<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://academic.oup.com/annweh/article/43/5/289/160067/Heat-balance-when-wearing-protective-clothing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://academic.oup.com/annweh/article/43/5/289/160067/Heat-balance-when-wearing-protective-clothing</a>]</p><p>Comfort properties of defence protective clothing</p><p><u>Extreme cold</u></p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-thermal-insulation-material-for-clothing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-thermal-insulation-material-for-clothing</a></p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinsulate" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Thinsulate</a> is considered &quot;the warmest thin apparel insulation&quot; available.
