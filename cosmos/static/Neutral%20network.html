<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>a <strong>neutral set</strong> is a set of
genotypes with the same phenotype. A neutral set is called
a <strong>neutral network</strong> if all genotypes in it can be connected
through series of single mutations that do not leave this
set. </p><p>Relevant in the study of the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Genotype-phenotype%2520map.html">Genotype-phenotype map</a> and its effect in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Evolution.html">Evolution</a>, and other search problems. See also <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Simplicity%2520bias.html">Simplicity bias</a></p><h2 class=""><u>Neutral network size estimator</u></h2><p><em>from Chico's thesis</em></p><p>we adapted Jörg et al’s Neutral Network Size Estimator (NNSE) [111] for Boolean
threshold networks. The NNSE algorithm falls within a class of Monte Carlo methods used
in statistical physics to investigate complex energy landscapes for which direct enumeration
techniques are too inneficient [165, 164]. The NNSE algorithm was originally developed to
study the RNA map, presented in Chapter 1, but Jörg et al. also note that their approach
should work “not only for RNA genotypes, but for any genotype space (discrete or contin-
uous) as long as a distance metric between phenotypes exists.”</p><p>The NNSE algorithm follows a nested Monte Carlo approach: given a discrete genotype
space, and the goal of estimating the number of genotypes that produce a given phenotype
x, one defines V (r) as the number of genotypes which map to phenotypes x 0 which are within
a distance d(x, x 0 ) ≤ r of phenotype x. The distance d(x, x 0 ) is defined in phenotype space,
ranging from d = 0 for identical phenotypes to d = d max for maximally different phenotypes.
In this way, V (r) can be seen as the “volume” inside a shell in phenotype space, centered
in x and with radius equal to r. Here we will be using V (r) to refer not only to the volume
of this shell, but to the shell itself, and to the set of genotypes mapping to phenotypes in
the shell. These concentric shells of radius r are – hence “nested Monte Carlo”.</p><p>The smallest shell is V (0), corresponding to the neutral network that maps to phenotype
x. Its volume can be expressed as a product of fraction of volumes of the concentric shells. These fractions are computed as follows: we perform a random walk in genotype space,
starting at a random genotype G 1 in V (r + 1) and adding one mutation to G t at every step
t. For Boolean networks, this mutation means changing one of the elements in its adjacency
matrix w ij , thus producing a new genotype G 0 . If G 0 is still within V (r + 1), G t+1 is set to
G 0 , otherwise G t+1 is set to G t . If this random walk is long enough, it will sample V (r + 1)
uniformly. Given that a fraction of V (r + 1) is also in V (r), the ratio
V (r)
V (r+1)
can then be
estimated from this sample.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-9-464" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Neutral network sizes of biological RNA molecules can be computed and are not atypically small</a></p><p>See wavenotebook for estimation of error of NSS using this method versus plain MonteCarlo estimation. <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/1p5vv90hmq" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.desmos.com/calculator/1p5vv90hmq</a></p><p><u><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Neutral%2520theory%2520of%2520evolution.html">Neutral theory of evolution</a></u></p><p>Evolutionary innovations arise when mutations that
explore variants of a functional phenotype strike a molecule
with a new and useful function. A large neutral network
can be of advantage in this process, because the
immediate neighborhood of a large neutral network in
sequence space contains many more phenotypic variants
than that of a smaller neutral network. Through neutral
evolution on large neutral networks, molecules can thus
get access to many molecular variants. This is why high
abundance of a phenotype can be argued to be beneficial
for evolutionary innovation [7]. </p></div>
