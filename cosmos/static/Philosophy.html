It is the study of the <strong>Cosmos</strong>, from the anthropocentric perspective, of our Knowledge of the Cosmos. This is, in a fundamental sense, all we have, since the physical, objective perspective, of the Cosmos ultimately derives from our Knowledge of it.</p><p>From this perspective, Cosmos gets equalled to our Knowledge of it. <strong>Philosophy</strong> concerns itself with the study of the Cosmos from this perspective, which basically by definition, encompasses everything else here, everything one ever thinks, and is conscious of. </p><p>I call this the <strong>observer perspective</strong>, and I think it's the most fundamental.</p><p>This is in contrast to the <strong>god perspective</strong> often taken in Science, where we imagine an objective reality separate from our minds (described in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Cosmography.html">Cosmography</a> and <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Cosmology.html">Cosmology</a>).

It encapsulates my concerns about what should we base reality on. If you look at your diagram, one can't really say which of the boxes is the base, as it's just a cycle.
&lt;&gt;This really makes me think of the strange loop ideas in Godel Escher Bach (GEB)!
The truth is that because we fundamentally only have access to our thoughts, we can never know for sure what the &quot;essence of reality&quot; really is..
While I think that the loop topology is nice, I wouldn't put the same boxes as you do. I actually think that the &quot;classic&quot; disciplines of science are not that far off, though I think your Figure 2 is. I personally like to organize science in a kind of complexity hierarchy. Physics describes the fundamental workings of matter. Chemistry describes properties of matter at the next scale of emergence/complexity. Biology at the next scale. And finally, what I call the system sciences, which are new scientific fields that deal with the most complex systems: computer science, cognitive science, social sciences, etc.
One can regard this complexity ladder, as a ladder of increasing information processing. And indeed one could close the loop, by asserting that these complex information processing systems, like the brain, computers, society, etc. are actually where the *information* about the world really resides. But that last step of the loop is a bit more philosophical/scientifically controversial. I guess people like hierarchies.. But, if we take the brave GEBian step of closing the loop, we have to face the foundamental subjectivity of reality, and all the problems that come with, specially in an increasingly transhumanist future: memory and perception alteration, virtual worlds, programmable matter. The truth is that I believe in an external physical world (the nature of which could be a simulation, or who knows), and it's good to remember that. The problems I mention are still important/hard though, specially because we are engineering subjectivness more and more into this world.</p><p>~ my comment to <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://maxandreblog.wordpress.com/2017/02/08/a-new-hierarchy-of-sciences/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blog post by Maxandre</a></p><hr><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Western_esotericism" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">esotericism</a></p><hr><p><em>What are your most fundamental principles?</em></p><p>March2017</p><p>To be honest, more and more, I've come to dislike &quot;fundamentalisms&quot; in general. More precisely, I just consider myself and what I know as too fallible to have certainty..
That being said one of the biggest principles on my world view. The only one that has really survived all scrutiny is what I call the Principle of Inclusiveness (don't know if it's the best name), but it just says that a world view is always better, the more of the totality of experience that is is able to include in it/account for.
In a sense it's a very obvious thing, but I like the grounding it gives me in comparing world views. Plus following drives one to explore, because exploration is the way to gain as many different experiences as possible. I think scientists in particular, but explorers/curious people in general, are just people who stretch the limits of Nature to see that which nobody has ever seen. 
As Alexander von Humboldt said &quot;The most dangerous worldview is the worldview of those who have not viewed the world&quot;.
This is both a life principle, and a foundation for epistemology.
Another principle is Joseph Campbell's idea of &quot;following your bliss&quot;, which I think means something like you should do what you really think/want to do.
But tbh, the most important principle and the hardest to actually carry out is the first one. The follow your bliss principle is pretty easy to accept, but it doesn't say much. The first principle means that you should always learn more about the world, and about yourself (which affects how the second principle manifests itself).</p><p>What I also like about that first principle, is that it doesn't impose any limits on where your quest of learning may take me. My world views may change a lot, and may evolve and adapt the more I experience. And as long as I don't do any &quot;willful disregard of the evidence, and a flight from self-knowledge&quot; (quoting Carl Sagan), or I don't &quot;fool myself&quot; (Feynman), then I should be improving my world view. And indeed my WV has changed a lot over the years, and that's good</p><p>The second principle came after this quest took me on a sort of existentialist crisis recently, where I found myself on a bottomless free fall of self-introspection, showing a lack of foundation. That 2nd principle laid a foundation at those very bottoms of the psyche. From which I could sustain the big castle of Knowledge that the 1st principle had building over the years..</p><hr><p>all experience is real. science gives a framework to understand reality (the things we experience).
Art and technology gives us ways to experience new or better things. Subjectivity is important for it affects all experience.</p></div>
