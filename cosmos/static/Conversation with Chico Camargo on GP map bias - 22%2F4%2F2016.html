Hey man!
I hadn't seen the recording, that's cool! I'll send you the slides via email. What diagrams do you want, just to make sure I send you the right thing?
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 12:56pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
Well the ones where you show the tree of binary states evolving to other states, and the ones showing the complexity vs frequency for example
Chico Camargo

Just one thing - recently I've changed my definition of phenotype to something more coarse-grained, so the plots for complexity have changed. But they're fine, the new ones say the same as the old ones. The robustness things, however, don't apply so directly to the new phenotype definition I've been exploring, so I would not include that part about robustness. All the rest is fine!
Chico Camargo
4/22, 1:03pm
Chico Camargo
Finally, an interesting paper, in case you haven't seen it: 
<a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royinterface/12/113/20150724.full.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royinterface/12/113/20150724.full.pdf</a>
Chico Camargo
4/22, 1:03pm
Chico Camargo
They say some cool stuff there, like &quot;The properties of genotype –phenotype (GP) maps have been studied in great detail for RNA secondary structure. These include a highly biased distribution of genotypes per phenotype, negative correlation of genotypic robustness and evolvability, positive correlation of phenotypic robustness
and evolvability, shape-space covering, and a roughly logarithmic scaling
of phenotypic robustness with phenotypic frequency. More recently similar
properties have been discovered in other GP maps, suggesting that they may
be fundamental to biological GP maps, in general, rather than specific to the
RNA secondary structure map.&quot;
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 2:53pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
Yeah i've seen that paper. I've found a way to predict more or less the number of sequences that map to the most frequent sequences, in average over the ensemble of transducers. It's only approximate, but it is about thinking about certain kinds of cycles, and how simpler cycles in the transducer are more probable, so sounds similar to your boolean network cycles thing. 
It's also related to the idea about constrained and unconstrained parts, which I think is the most fundamental. The idea for transducers is that there are states that give the same output independent of the output (so they are unconstrained). Outputs that admit cycling through these states have most of the input bits unconstrained. Then if one looks at what kinds of cycles there are, one sees that the most probable are the simplest ones, and these correspond to simple outputs
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 2:59pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
It's not totally rigorous, but estimating the probabilities of these cycles roughly gives the right frequency of the most probable strings like 11111111.. 011111111, 101010101... etc
Chico Camargo
4/22, 3:02pm
Chico Camargo
That is very interesting!
On the boolean networks it turns out that the probability of a cyclic output is an exponential with the cycle length, but the complexity bias exists even for cycles of the same length
I still don't understand how the GP map works though, maybe because I don't fully understand what a transducer really is. What is the genotype and the phenotype (and the mapping), in their case?
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 3:04pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
grrwhen i said above &quot;same output independent of the output&quot; i meant &quot;same output independent of the input&quot;...
Chico Camargo
4/22, 3:04pm
Chico Camargo
Oh yeah I god that grin emoticon
So, I understand that a finite state transducer is like a finite automaton, but with two tapes: an input tape and an output tape
reads a tape and writes another

Guillermo Valle Pérez
its a finite state machine. You start at a certain state and move to the state according to the symbol you read and following the transition according to the first symbol in &quot;x/y&quot;. When you follow that transition you print a &quot;y&quot;
oh sorry
in that picture i showed you the x and y are swapped
relative to my convention
that picture isnt ver good
wait
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 3:09pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 3:09pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
thats one of the ones generated by my actual code
sideways lol
Chico Camargo
4/22, 3:09pm
Chico Camargo
Beautiful!
Ok, it's a finite state machine with two tapes, rather than just traversing (and accepting or rejecting) an input string, it translates an input string to an output string
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 3:09pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
so you begin at state 0 and if you see a 0 you go to state 0 printing a 0, and if you see an 1 you go to state 1 also printing a 0
Chico Camargo
4/22, 3:09pm
Chico Camargo
Cool
So you randomly generate a finite state transducer, and see how many input words give you each output word?
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 3:10pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
Yep
Chico Camargo
4/22, 3:11pm
Chico Camargo
And the trends are the same even if you generate a lot of those transducers at random?
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 3:11pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
yeah the more you generate the more the graph seems to be a linear thing with a given spread in the frequency-vs-complexity, like the one i posted
technically you could enumerate all transducers of a given number of states
Chico Camargo
4/22, 3:13pm
Chico Camargo
So the trend is there even if you have a single transducer, but it's more obvious if you plot the results for a lot of them, is that what you're saying?
I have more questions:
How long are the input strings?
How long are the output strings?
You said you can enumerate them. How is the transducer represented?
I was reading some stuff about formal language theory last night, and it relates so much to that, you have no idea
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 3:14pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
Well, the trend is mostly visible if you plot a lot of them. For a single one I tend to find quite some noise.
The input strings ive tried are 9-15 bits long,  but they can be anything
I've made it so that the output strings are the same length as the input. I could make the variable length by adding an &quot;empty&quot; symbol as a possibility
but havent tried that
The transducers are represented as strings too I think, but I'm using a finite automaton generator, not generating them on my own
because it's not that trivial to generate them really uniformly apparently. I think it's because many automatons would be equivalent, and it only generates distinct ones..
Chico Camargo
4/22, 3:17pm
Chico Camargo
I see
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 3:17pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
Tho I'm not sure how it's generating them under the hood tbh, atm
Chico Camargo
4/22, 3:17pm
Chico Camargo
Sure
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 3:18pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
and i dont think the answer should be too different if you generated them in a more naive way
Chico Camargo
4/22, 3:18pm
Chico Camargo
I agree with you
One thing I'm trying to understand is what space is being mapped to what space
But I'm slowly getting it
Any string to any string.
(well, binary strings in both alphabets, in this case)
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 3:21pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
yeah you can choose any alphabet. But i chose binary. and in my case its any binary string to given length to the same set
well no there are some strings you can't get in the output
so the output space is some subset of {1,0}^*
{1,0}^n, n fixed i mean
Chico Camargo
4/22, 3:23pm
Chico Camargo
And there are binary strings that can't be generated by that transducer. Sure
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 3:23pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
Yeah
quite a few actually
which make sense
Chico Camargo
4/22, 3:24pm
Chico Camargo
It does.
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 3:24pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
becuase if there is redundancy, the phenotype space must be smaller, for a deterministic map
smaller than genotype space
Chico Camargo
4/22, 3:25pm
Chico Camargo
And because each transducer will in fact produce strings of a given shape,
like &quot;0 1^n 0 1 0^m 1&quot;
And when you choose the number of states in your transducer.. I would imagine
I imagine very large transducers would be unnecessarily complex
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 3:27pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
well i choose a small number of states, like 5 so that it's simple
Chico Camargo
4/22, 3:28pm
Chico Camargo
Yeap
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 3:28pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
I've tried more states and results are not too different, but I worry that I am taking a sample that is much smaller than all possible trandsucers of that size
With smaller number of states like 2 or 3, maps seem too trivial also
Chico Camargo
4/22, 3:30pm
Chico Camargo
I'd expect that the complexity bias would become too messy if the transducers were too large: you'd be using a very complex algorithm to map input to output, introducing a lot of complexity into the business
I find it interesting that when you sample different transducers, you're sampling different GP maps.
...which is something that can evolve, as well. Just like you can change the parameters of an ODE instead of changing its initial conditions, you can change the GP map instead of its I/O
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 3:32pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
what i can't quite figure is how to relate these results more directly to other results like that of the boolean network or polyominoes. Yeah, in principles these things should map to a transducer, but how simple a transducer, and do they have some features that simply the {ensemble of all transducers} does not capture. I mean this is precisely the same problems with choosing random network null models in network theory..
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 3:32pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
Yeah i also expect more noise for more states..
Chico Camargo
4/22, 3:33pm
Chico Camargo
So, normally a boolean network is the genotype, so your input string in this case. Same for an RNA sequence. Your transducer would be the actual map
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 3:35pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
&quot;which is something that can evolve&quot;. Yeah the whole reason I did was just in the spirit of null models: see if one expects these features just looking at random simple maps, without any other constraint.
But I also thought about, why choose the transducers uniformly at random, why not sample them according to the biased output of another transducer, that will produce simpler transducers more often. One can imagine a potentially infinite chain of GP maps determining GP maps, and it'd be interesting to see what one gets..
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 3:35pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
Yeah the whole reason I did -&gt; Yeah the whole reason I did this
Chico Camargo
4/22, 3:36pm
Chico Camargo
I agree with the spirit of null models: that is totally the point
Hoho, I know what you mean!
In fact I think there is something else to it
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 3:37pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
Yeah this looks like whats called hyperparameter optimization in machine learning: when you optimize your machine learning model itself
Or genetic programming with evolving GP maps, which has also been tried
Another way to do this would be to make a transducer whose output changes the transducer itself, and see how that evolves
which tbh sounds like the whole idea of genetic regulatory networks where the phenotype (proteins) in some sense change the GP map (genes-&gt;proteins)
I guess when one does this one can then still define a meta GP map like what you do in the boolean networks
Chico Camargo
4/22, 3:41pm
Chico Camargo
I think so
Coupling GP maps is an interesting idea
But you've gotta play with the timescales that that involves
For example
- also on that potentially infinite chain of GP maps you mentioned:
Chico Camargo
4/22, 3:42pm
Chico Camargo
So, this chain of GP maps determining GP maps is sequential: once, in the history of life, life &quot;chose&quot; a set of basepairs, A-T, C-G. And it's been working pretty much with all that. And by &quot;choosing&quot; I mean that its rate of change slowed down. It could be from reaching a fitness peak, local or not, but the fact is that it slowed down.
Then, at some point, life &quot;chose&quot; a genetic code: the way codons map to aminoacids. Once that choice was frozen, life has been working with it ever since.
Then it chose some protein families. It chose chromosomes. Yada, yada, yada: (pretty much) frozen choices allowing more complex forms to emerge. And you could argue that the genetic code and these other things are still changing, but they're just changing very slowly, while other things change more quickly
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 3:43pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
Hm, I see what you mean
Chico Camargo
4/22, 3:43pm
Chico Camargo
In a similar fashion, I see that with language. We aren't really changing our alphabet, or our grammar structures anymore, it seems like those evolved once and stopped, but they're just changing slowly. On the other hand, new words still appear all the time
I think it makes total sense to get the transducer from a set of transducers
- but if you're picking a simple transducer, you're probably already doing that
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 3:44pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
well im picking simple ones in the sens of small number of states
Chico Camargo
4/22, 3:45pm
Chico Camargo
If the transducer can really be represented as a string, then I'd be sure of that
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 3:45pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
but i haven tried generating transducers from a transducer
yet
but in your example above
it seems like it would like generating random transducers and then fixing to one. Then using that fixed transducers as maybe a building block out of which new meta transducers can be built...
tho im not sure i understand where GP maps fit in all the biological examples you mention above
Chico Camargo
4/22, 3:49pm
Chico Camargo
a GP map is a translation, an I/O machine, a transducer. Something that converts information of a kind into information of another kind
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 3:50pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
first the atcg is an alphabet, not a GP map right? Then it evolved the codon-aminoacid, which i see its a GP map. What is the protein family, and what do the chromosomes have to do with a GP map?
i mean I would understand that gene-&gt; protein is a GP map. Then protein-&gt;some cellular phenotype is another one..
Chico Camargo
4/22, 3:52pm
Chico Camargo
Ok, point taken, the ATCG is not a GP map. It is an alphabet.
Let me put it this way:
Chico Camargo
4/22, 3:59pm
Chico Camargo
Nature chooses a way store information, then it pretty much settles for that one according to some criteria like thermodynamical stability and to how much information you can store with that system - for instance, ATCG basepairs. Or, another way to store information, aminoacids. So now we have two alphabets, one with four letters, one with ~20.
Then, once those had been pretty much chosen, eventually nature chose/found a way to translate between them. Or maybe it found the latter alphabet as an outcome of finding the GP map that converts information stored in DNA sequences to information stored in aminoacid sequences. But anyway, it chose the alphabets, then it chose the GP map.
Focusing on the GP maps: DNA-&gt; Proteins, Protein shape-&gt; Protein function in the cell, gene networks -&gt; cellular phenotype, cell type composition -&gt; tissue structure/function/identity, whatever mapping from one kind of information to another (but just mappings, so nothing about the chromosomes I had mentioned). My point is that I think often nature tries many &quot;transducers&quot;, many I/O machines, and eventually it chooses some of them, and builds on top of them. So the I/O alphabets and GP maps are conserved along evolution.
In this sense, humans probably use the same cell types as other apes. And we all use the same body plans as other mammals. And the same embryonic development genes as worms. Etc etc downards, ad infinitum.
Chico Camargo
4/22, 4:01pm
Chico Camargo
I'm saying this because some structures evolve quickly and others don't: in the hierarchy of which genes regulate which other ones, the further up a gene is placed, the less it changes over time: the more conserved it is.
And I think that makes total sense, considering that it is part of a GP map that was &quot;chosen&quot; long ago
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 4:02pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
and because many things depend on it, it's hard to change right?
Chico Camargo
4/22, 4:02pm
Chico Camargo
that too
in theory you could change it, but today that'd mean a drastic reduction on fitness
it'd be like trying to reinvent the genetic code: it won't work, life relies too much on that
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 4:03pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
that's what I mean, unless you change many things along with it, in just the right ways.. which is highly unlikely
Chico Camargo
4/22, 4:03pm
Chico Camargo
Exactly
That'd be like changing the English grammar, or semantics
On the other hand, if the evolutionary innovation is pretty fresh, there's probably not much relying on it, so it's ok to break it
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 4:06pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
This is just why it's so hard to say switch from qwerty to dvorak keyboards, it's changing your whole word-hand movement GP map, on which your whole internet life depends
Chico Camargo
4/22, 4:06pm
Chico Camargo
haha
yeah!
So, I think the easiest story you can tell is that a transducer is a very simple a GP map, without all the biological details.
Which features did you say are not captured by the transducers?
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 4:09pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
Well in theory all GP maps should potentially be expressed as transducers, though probably of many more states. Having 5 states is like considering the set of sufficiently coarse-grained biological models I suppose..
Chico Camargo
4/22, 4:11pm
Chico Camargo
Hm, there is one thing I still don't  see
What you said resonates very well with the ideas in that paper I sent you: that all these properties come from the sequence nature of genotypes and phenotypes
or genotypes at least.
and sequences = I/O strings, great
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 4:13pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
If you consider any number of states, transducers pretty much include everything else.. But I'm only considering simple ones.
A simple transducer can either be justified as some process during the earliest stages of evolution of some form of life (natural or artificial) where the system itself is actually simple. Say a few dots in game of life, or a few molecules.
Then the justification to apply to more complex life is probably the same as why we use coarse-grained models: yeah life is full of intricate details, but it is organized in such a way that is approximately simple.
I think this would like saying complex life is really behainv as a transducer with many many states, but this transducer is coarse-grainable to a transducer of few states.
This actually agrees nicely with the idea that life current GP maps were in some way determined by previous GP maps, and thus are expected to be simpler than just a random GP map from ATCG to tissue...
Chico Camargo
4/22, 4:14pm
Chico Camargo
Yeah
I'm happy with that
there is only one thing that I still fail to agree/understand
A transducer translates input to output by treating the input as an (ordered) string: it first reads the first character, then the second, then the third
And even though the map in the end is from string A to string B, it's calculated from this step-by-step reading
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 4:15pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
that's how it &quot;mechanically&quot; works yeah
Chico Camargo
4/22, 4:16pm
Chico Camargo
Yeah
But for example, a gene network. The network, really. It can be written as a string, but you can also do any permutations on the gene order, and that'd give you a different string.
The GP map for gene networks is also from string to string, but it doesn't rely on reading anything step by step
and it's harder for me to talk about &quot;what parts of the string are unconstrained&quot;, for instance
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 4:17pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
&quot;written as a string, but you can also do any permutations on the gene order, and that'd give you a different string.&quot; but it'd give you the same network, you mean?
Chico Camargo
4/22, 4:17pm
Chico Camargo
It'd give you a network that is isomorphic to it (like, B-&gt;A instead of A-&gt;B). That could possibly give you the same phenotype
or an isomorphic phenotype. Hm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 4:18pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
but i mean, if you have some map from finite strings to finite strings, it is always in principle writeable as a finite transducer
Chico Camargo
4/22, 4:18pm
Chico Camargo
Oh. That's true.
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 4:18pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
the transducer may be quite large though
Chico Camargo
4/22, 4:18pm
Chico Camargo
There's a theorem that does that, right?
that says that
shit. That's awesome.
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 4:19pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
yeah... I mean it's kind of floating around the results of turing and church and co. I think
A Turing machin is just a kind of finite transducer with infinite memory
so like infinite number of states..
Chico Camargo
4/22, 4:20pm
Chico Camargo
yeah yeah
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 4:20pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
But the thing is that a map between two finite sets can always be expressible with finite memory
Chico Camargo
4/22, 4:20pm
Chico Camargo
no, there is, I'm sure
I read this theorem yesterday, it's all coming back

4/22, 4:20pm

There is a correspondence between formal grammars (sets of strings) and automata (that might accept or reject a string, saying that it does or doesn't belong in that grammar).
Finite grammars map to finite automata,
Context-free grammars to push-down automata, and so on,
Until phrase structure grammars that map to Turing machines.
Grammars and finite automata are slightly different from FST, but I'm sure there must be a version of that theorem that talks about FST.
Chico Camargo
4/22, 4:24pm
Chico Camargo
Ah brilliant!
That's really interesting, since any finite set is enumerable (and more specifically enumerable in binary), any finite set can be translated to strings.
But that alone doesn't mean that you would have any bias of any sort
Now it's clear to me that it isn't about the sequence order, as in which part comes first, but simply from the hypercube nature of the space of sequences

what is comes &quot;from the hypercube nature of the space of sequences&quot;?
Chico Camargo
4/22, 4:32pm
Chico Camargo
yup! I see it
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 4:33pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
Also the bias comes from constraining the maps to be simple in the sense of few states in the fst, I think. Clearly if you considered all possible maps between two sets there wouldn't be bias in average
i meant: what comes &quot;from the hypercube nature of the space of sequences&quot;?
my internal fst is making so many mistakes..
Chico Camargo
4/22, 4:34pm
Chico Camargo
I agree that if you considered all the possible FST you wouldn't get any nice average, you need simple FSTs
haha have you switched to dvorak?
Chico Camargo
4/22, 4:34pm
Chico Camargo
What I mean is that the paper I sent you they say:
&quot;The Fibonacci GP map therefore offers strong evidence that the sequential nature of biological information determines the fundamental structure of GP maps, which in turn has a profound impact on the course of biological evolution.&quot;
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 4:35pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
no i meant internal as in in the brain. I wanted to swithc to dvorak but havent had time tongue emoticon
Yeah I didn't get that part
Chico Camargo
4/22, 4:35pm
Chico Camargo
And when they say &quot;the sequential nature&quot;, I think it suggests that the fact that information is stored in ordered sequences. But I think it isn't so much about that
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 4:35pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
Yeah I thought it was more about it having constrained and unconstrained parts
which doesnt say anything about how the information is stored/read
Chico Camargo
4/22, 4:36pm
Chico Camargo
Yeah. I think the order doesn't really matter.
exactly.
and the unconstrained parts could be in the beginning, middle, end, or just have no order
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 4:37pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
yeah, in fact in the fsts unconstrained parts are not a fixed portion of the input string, but depend on the previous portions of the input string
Chico Camargo
4/22, 4:37pm
Chico Camargo
as long as you have an unconstrained part whose contribution to the designability of your phenotype size grows exponentially (or just a lot) with the size of the unconstrained part: like 4^L, in the case of RNA, or 2^L in the binary case
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 4:38pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
&quot;An unconstrained part&quot; should more correctly be a property of the FST mechanism than a part of the input string. In the FSTs, an unconstrained part is a state whose outputs are the same irresepective of input.
Chico Camargo
4/22, 4:39pm
Chico Camargo
indeed
unconstrained means ignored by the GP map
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 4:40pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
In the case of the FSTs as you grow the length of the input, the input has more chances of looping through these states and everytime you go through it the number of possibilities multiplies by 2, so it grows almost exponentially
Chico Camargo
4/22, 4:40pm
Chico Camargo
so if the GP map doesn't care about sequence/string order, the unconstrained parts of the genotype won't be ordered, won't be &quot;after a stop codon&quot;
yeah
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 4:41pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
well there may be some order to them, but may be more complicated and subtle, and not-apparent
Chico Camargo
4/22, 4:43pm
Chico Camargo
but see, a gene network isn't ordered per se. When you decide to represent it as a string, sure, you've ordered it. For the same GP map, different orderings will produce different transducers, and therefore different orderings of the unconstrained parts, but there is no inherent order on a gene network
Chico Camargo
4/22, 4:44pm
Chico Camargo
There is, though, an exponential contribution to designability: 3^X, where X is the number of &quot;unconstrained&quot; interactions
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 4:44pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
And you can actually construct GP maps where the bias is towards some designed complex sequence instead of towards simple ones. However these require very special kinds of structures with the sequence coded into it, while a bias towards a simple output requires a simple structure, and thus appears often in FSTs
Chico Camargo
4/22, 4:45pm
Chico Camargo
precisely.
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 4:46pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
yeah i agree that for the network the output shouldnt depend on the ordering. However, maybe due to the nature of the FST different ordering conventions may need different FSTs
Chico Camargo
4/22, 4:46pm
Chico Camargo
Yeah
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 4:47pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
&quot;3^X, where X is the number of &quot;unconstrained&quot; interactions&quot;. what are the uncstrained interactions?
Chico Camargo
4/22, 4:47pm
Chico Camargo
the genotype for a gene network is the network's directed graph
each link between nodes A and B can be +, -, or non-existent (0). That's what I called 'interactions': these links
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 4:49pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
and it is unconstrained if it doesnt affect the phenotype you define?
Chico Camargo
4/22, 4:50pm
Chico Camargo
Exactly. When I said &quot;There is, though, an exponential contribution to designability: 3^X, where X is the number of &quot;unconstrained&quot; interactions&quot;, I meant that if there are X interactions that can be a +, a - or an 0 and that won't make a difference for the resulting phenotype, they'll be increasing the designability of that phenotype by 3^X.
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 4:53pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
It'd be interesting to find the actual FST for the network description to cycle/phenotype
and see if those unconstrained parts can be seen as unconstrained states in the fst
Chico Camargo
4/22, 4:54pm
Chico Camargo
I mean, if for every GP map there is a FST, it should be
I'm still pondering
This sequence story: The cause for all these properties would not be &quot;sequential nature of biological information&quot;, but the fact that in nature you often have unconstrained parts whose contribution to the designability of your phenotype size grows exponentially.
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 4:58pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
Yeah
Chico Camargo
4/22, 4:58pm
Chico Camargo
Well, it's from the same principles behind PCA, that most things need a short description
that's sloppiness, essentially
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 4:58pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
PCA?
Chico Camargo
4/22, 4:59pm
Chico Camargo
Principal Component Analysis. It's a technique that effectively reduces the dimensionality of a dataset by finding a set of axes (the base, in linear algebra terms) where most of the variation in your dataset can be described by the first axes
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 5:00pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
Ah yeah. Yeah I mean, we are trying to find (at least part) of the explanation of the simplicity in the word smile emoticon
Chico Camargo
4/22, 5:01pm
Chico Camargo
in the word and in the world? wink emoticon
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 5:02pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
haha yeah lucky mistake
Chico Camargo
4/22, 5:02pm
Chico Camargo
Man, I'm really hungry, I gotta get some lunch
But let's keep talking about this! This is really exciting, and it's awesome to talk to you about that grin emoticon
Also, would you send me your code so I play with it as well?
Guillermo Valle Pérez
4/22, 5:04pm
Guillermo Valle Pérez
Sure, i'll put it on github and share! And yeah we'should talk again
Chico Camargo
4/22, 5:04pm
Chico Camargo
Sweet!
See you later then!
