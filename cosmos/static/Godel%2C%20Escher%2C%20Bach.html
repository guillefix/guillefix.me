We must simulate the substrate (like neural nets) because that is the level on which the system is formal, and thus simulatable. At the above level, the system is informal. Relation to coarse-graining and emergence. I think what happens is a combination of: (1) at the low level the computational rules are easier, and thus easy to simulate, even if there are more detail; (2) At the high level, the rules may be too probabilistic to capture the intelligent behaviour in enough detail anyways. Now, at the time of publication of GEB, AI researchers understood this, but thought that neural simulation was not necessary, as other substrates may be better/easier to simulate. This may well be true, but today's most successful systems are taking considerable inspiration from biological neurons (but not totally, e.g. they often ignore spikes)</li><li>Critique of the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Soul.html">Soul</a>ist position. The irrational and rational can coexist on different levels (p. 575). No reason to suppose the brain doesn't follow physics, faultlessly, and that the variety of behaviour, including mostly irrational ones, are just emergent on higher levels (what he calls <em>epiphenomena</em>). This, I think, is the most likely explanation of brain behaviour. <sub>The point-a point which has been made several times earlier in various contexts-is simply  that  meaning  can  exist  on  two  or  more  different  levels  of  a  symbol-handling  system,  and  along  with  meaning,  rightness  and  wrongness  can  exist  on  all  those  levels.  </sub> <strong>The brain is rational; the mind may not be</strong>.</li><li>He hypothesizes a unity of <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Intelligence.html">Intelligence</a>s (p. 579, and the chapter on Meaning in language), but I'm not convinced about this.
