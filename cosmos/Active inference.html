<p>We have shown recently that adaptive behaviour can be prescribed by prior expectations about sensory inputs, which action tries to fulfill [6]. This is calledactive inference</p><p>See <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Free%20energy%20principle">Free energy principle</a>, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Inference">Inference</a>, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Machine%20learning">Machine learning</a>, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Reinforcement%20learning">Reinforcement learning</a></p><p>Essentially, active inference replaces value-learning with perceptual learning that optimises empirical (acquired) priors in the agentâ€™s internal model of its world. These priors specify the free energy associated with sensory signals and guide action to ensure sensations conform to prior beliefs.</p>
