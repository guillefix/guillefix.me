However, this doesn't take into account whether some functions may be very similar to each other. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://guillefix.me/cosmos/static/VC%2520dimension.html\">Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension</a>  is a more sophisticated measure of expressivity that takes this into account, giving a measure of \"effective size\".</p>\n        <B1>\n        <div>What does VC try to measure?</div>\n        <exp>\n          <p>To understand VC dimension better, let's explain what it tries to capture. In binary classification, the VC dimension determines whether a hypothesis class ${\"\\\\mathcal{H}\"}$ has the <emph>uniform convergence property</emph>, which means that with high probability over the sampling of the training set <u>every</u> function in ${\"\\\\mathcal{H}\"}$ has a training error which is close to its generalization error. In particular, the VC dimension determines how large the training set needs to be for this property to hold. This in turn allows one to obtain generalization error upper bounds which are <u>worst-case over all empirical-risk-minimizing algorithms and data distributions</u>.</p>\n          <p>If the VC dimension is infinite, then the uniform convergence property doesn't hold, no matter how large the training set. Such a hypothesis class is said to <i>not be PAC-learnable</i>. However, remember this learnability property is worst-case over algorithms and distributions. So your particular algorithm/problem may still allow for generalization even if using this hypothesis class.</p>\n          <p>To understand these kinds of generalization bounds better, see the explanation at <a href=\"#pac-bayes-theorem\">PAC-Bayes theorem</a> below.</p>\n          <B1>\n          <div>Hecc, but what is the actual definition of VC dimension?</div>\n          <exp>\n          <p>\n          Fine, the VC dimension is the size of the largest set of input points that your hypothesis class can <i>shatter</i>.

You know people talk about VC dimension/capacity/expressivity? The idea of those measures is that if you have many different functions that your algorithm can output, then it may overfit, and not generalize. Conversely, if it has few functions it's considering, and it is still able to fit the training data with one, then one can be confident, that it will generalize well outside the training data.</p>\n      <p>You can think of a probabilistic prior over functions $P(f)$ as a \"smoothed\" version of limiting the set of functions (<i>hypothesis class</i> in jargon), where one instead makes the algorithm prefer some functions much much more than others, but it doesn't <i>completely</i> rule the others out. PAC-Bayes gives guarantees on the generalization error for algorithms with such prior.</p>\n      <B1>\n      <span>But why can we be confident of generalization, when the hypothesis class is small?</span>\n      <exp>\n      <p>You have to keep asking why, don't you? I like curious people like you ^^</p>\n      <p>The main argument is found in the proof of bounds in basic Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) theory</p>\n      <p>Imagine a single function in your hypothesis class that has an actual generalization error which is high, meaning that on a random input, it is likely to disagree with the ground truth function, assumed fixed. Call $p$ the probability that it classifies correctly upon a random input ($1-p$ is probability that it missclassifies).</p>\n      <p>It is very unlikely that that function has a small classification error (let alone $0$ error) on a reasonably sized training set, say of size $m=1000$. Just think of every input sample you do as flipping a coin with a low probability $p$ of head (now you'll see how important the i.i.d. assumption in supervised learning theory is!). Now think of how inlekily it is that you get all heads, in $1000$ samples! Very unlikely. Exponentially so, in fact, $p^m$</p>\n      <p>But, what if the algorithm is considering among a largeeee set of functions, say $H$ of them. Well, what we really care about is if there exists one among those functions that has a large generalization error $p$, and a $0$ traning error. The existence of one such function is enough to <i>not be able to guarantee</i> generalization, if all we know about the algorithm is that it picks a function with $0$ training error. Who are you to say that it won't pick the bad one if it exists?</p>\n      <p>It's tricky in general to work out the probability that there exist one more or more such functions. It depends on the set of functions, and it's the thing that Vapnik and Chervonenkis worked so hard to understand.</p>\n      <p>But we can easily upper bound it, using the so-called union bound. Intuitively, if each individual function of error $1-p$ (or higher) has a probability $p^m$ (or smaller) of having $0$ training error. Then {\"\\{the probability that there exists \"}<i>at least one</i>{\" function on a set of $H$ such functions that has $0$ training error\\} \"}is at most $Hp^m$. Makes intuitive sense, if you have {\"$2^{1000}$\"} functions with low probability of correct classification $p$, you may not be so suprised if one just happened to fit the training set, even if each one individually is very unlikely</p>\n      <p>So if we require that the probability of this bad thing to happen to be low, say at most $\\delta$, then we can rearrange, {\"$Hp^m< \\\\delta$\"}. Well, it's easier if we call the probability of error $\\epsilon$, so {\"$p=1-\\\\epsilon < e^{-\\\\epsilon}$\"}, and then it's enough to have {\"$He^{-m\\\\epsilon}< \\\\delta$\"}, which rearranges to {\"$\\\\epsilon > \\\\frac{\\\\log{H}+\\\\log{\\\\frac{1}{\\\\delta$}}}{m}$\"}</p>\n      <p>huh? that looks like a lower bound to me. Actually, we need to be careful with our logical statement. We said that if {\"$\\\\epsilon > \\\\frac{\\\\log{H}+\\\\log{\\\\frac{1}{\\\\delta$}}}{m}$\"}, then {\"{ {the probability of one function with $0$ training error among the functions that have true error $\\\\epsilon$ or higher} is smaller than $\\\\delta$}\"}. So we actually gave the name \"$\\epsilon$\" to the <i>upper bound on the true error</i> not to the actual true error. So the above is a lower bound, on the upper bound we want :PP. We want the tightest (smallest) upper bound. So let's take {\"$\\\\frac{\\\\log{H}+\\\\log{\\\\frac{1}{\\\\delta$}}}{m}$\"}. The true error is smaller than that with probability $1-\\delta$ </p>\n      <p>I know that is <u>a lot</u> to take in. But the point is that, there you have it, we can give a guarantee (holding with high probability, if we make delta very small), on the generalization error, which is smaller, the smallest the set of functions the algorithm considers.</p>\n      </exp>\n      </B1>\n      </exp>\n    </B1>\n    <B2>Ah I see. So the bound depends on the data via $P(U)$, which is nothing but the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Marginal_likelihood\">marginal likelihood</a> of the labels on the data, given by the prior $P(f)$.
